## User research insights
Problem: Initial feedback indicates that users find food logging challenging due to its time-consuming nature and the difficulty of maintaining consistency. This leads to a higher likelihood of users abandoning the process.

Solution:
Leveraging AI to simplify and accelerate food logging. This can be achieved by allowing users to:

- Scan barcodes,
- Take a picture of a restaurant menu description, or
- Upload a photo of their meal for automatic recognition.
- This approach aims to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and improve long-term adherence.
