Event Streaming & Engagement App

OverviewI worked as a UX/UI designer on an application designed to streamline life events and provide virtual event experiences. The platform enables users to watch events live or on-demand while engaging through interactive features such as Q&A sessions, polls, and live chat with other attendees.

Before and after an event, users can access a dedicated event page featuring speaker descriptions, a personal dashboard, event schedules, personalized agendas, and more.

Team & CollaborationThe project was developed by a cross-functional team, including:

3 UX/UI Designers

Design Lead

Developers

Stakeholders

Project Managers

My specific role focused on designing the tablet and desktop breakpoints for the platform.

Challenges & SolutionsOne of the biggest challenges was designing the event calendar. As we approached tight deadlines, we proposed multiple calendar views to improve user experience. However, the development team highlighted that implementing our initial designs would take three times longer than expected.

To address this, we initiated close collaboration with the developers, holding frequent meetings to refine the design while maintaining functionality. By working together, we successfully adjusted the design to balance usability and development feasibility.

Outcome
Through effective collaboration, we delivered a well-structured, user-friendly event calendar that met both user needs and technical constraints. The project was completed on time, ensuring a seamless experience for event attendees across devices.
