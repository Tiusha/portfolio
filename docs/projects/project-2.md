## Results and Reflections
As the lead product designer for a customizable vaping platform, I faced and overcame many challenges, gaining valuable insights that boosted my design skills and professional growth. This project was more than just a technical task; it was an exploration of user psychology and brand interaction.

The redesign had a significant positive impact on user engagement, with a 314% increase in users and a 196% rise in customized design sales three months post-launch. However, collaboration with PMs and developers was crucial, ensuring their input and technical constraints were considered throughout. This success, combined with other projects, has propelled the Canadian market into the top three among over 25 countries globally. These results will continue to improve as users become more familiar with the platform.

## Achievements
### Enhanced engagement
 By introducing a platform that allowed users to personalize their vaping devices, we significantly increased user engagement. This initiative transformed passive buyers into active participants in the brand's ecosystem, deepening their connection to the product.

### Brand differentiation
The customizable platform sets the brand apart in a competitive market. By offering a unique and personal user experience, we not only retained a loyal customer base but also attracted new users intrigued by the prospect of personalization.

### Positive feedback
The feedback from users and stakeholders was overwhelmingly positive, reaffirming the project’s success. The platform was praised for its intuitive design and user-friendly interface, which made the customization process a delightful experience.


## Personal insights
### User-centric design 
A key takeaway from this project was prioritizing user needs throughout the design process. From conceptualization to execution, our focus on user satisfaction ensured the platform was both accessible and valuable, fostering engagement at every step.

### Iterative process 
The project reinforced the value of iterative design and agile methodologies. Continuous testing, feedback, and refinements were instrumental in developing a platform that truly resonated with users and met business objectives.

### Collaboration and Leadership
Leading a cross-functional team taught me the importance of collaboration and effective communication. Working closely with developers, product managers, and marketing professionals, I gained a broader perspective on how design integrates with other disciplines to create a cohesive product.
