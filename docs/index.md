# hi there! 👋🏻
I'm Anastasia, a naturally curious product designer with a love for learning and a deep appreciation for both soft and hard skills. I believe that great design is not just about creating something beautiful but also about making it meaningful and intuitive for users.

Throughout my career, I’ve developed user experiences and product designs for omni-channel platforms. I wear many hats, from collaborating with clients and presenting to stakeholders to gathering insights and running user interviews. One of the most rewarding parts of my work is simplifying complex tasks to make them more accessible for the end user. I enjoy tackling challenging projects and building design libraries that significantly boost our team’s speed and consistency.

My passion for optimizing workflows drives me to reduce cognitive load for users. Whether I’m creating intuitive filters or refining design elements, I always aim to make the experience as accessible and seamless as possible. I have a solid understanding of accessibility standards and am committed to crafting inclusive designs for all users.

With over five years of experience in designing for web and native apps, I’m skilled at adapting designs to each platform’s unique needs. My work spans various industries, including D2C, B2B, B2C, public sector, healthcare, finance, and entertainment. I’ve built projects from the ground up in startup settings, taking on every stage of the design process. Collaborating with developers, product managers, and stakeholders, I strive to create scalable and impactful solutions.

A bit more about me: Moving to 🇨🇦 Canada alone taught me resilience and adaptability—qualities I bring into every design challenge with a smile and a creative twist. I’m logical, empathetic, and genuinely invested in crafting designs that make users happy because I believe happy users lead to successful businesses.
